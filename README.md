# Physics-inspired Equivariant Descriptors of Non-bonded Interactions - Auxiliary Code Repository

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2308.13208-B31B1B.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13208)
[![Materials Cloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/materialscloud-org/mcloud-badge/main/badges/img/mcloud_badge_archive.svg)](https://materialscloud.org/)

The repository includes auxiliary codes, which are not available in other public repositories. This includes
Python classes to generate splined radial integrals for
[rascaline](https://luthaf.fr/rascaline/latest/references/api/python/utils/splines.html)
as well as the source code to train and evaluate the neural network potential of dimers.
All Python source files are located in the [src](src) folder.

An example how to construct the linear models used in the publication can be 
found in the [lab COSMO Software Cookbook](https://software-cookbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lode_linear/lode_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-lode-linear-lode-tutorial-py).
